# Lending-Club-Case-Study
> When it comes to credit risk & loan issuances it's imperative to understand the risk profile of the loan applicants. It is also important to look at their history & their current repaying capability to avoid defaults in the future. This analysis is a check on the client base for a credit health check with the available data.

## General Information
- Understand the creadit default patternd and risk of retail loans
- Mitigate the losses which may arise from loan defaults

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Loan Amount & Funded amount are highly correlated, which is a good sign in terms of credit outlooks
- The issued loan has a dependency on income in general, which makes sense, as higher the income > lesser the credit risk
- Bi-variate Analysis - As the number of delinquencies in the past 2 years go up, the loan amount issued also constantly goes down. These are inversely proportional as expected
